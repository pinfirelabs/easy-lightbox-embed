# easy-lightbox-embed
Self-contained scripts to open a link inside of a lightbox iframe

This code uses (iframe-lightbox)[https://github.com/englishextra/iframe-lightbox] to open an iframe-based lightbox, but wraps it in a simple layer to allow for two line insertion into a parent site, allowing for clients to easily embed out site into their own.
